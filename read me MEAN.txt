connecting to database:
open command prompt and go to the following directory 
"C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.2\bin"

type the command "mongod --dbpath C:\manasa\projectname\data\" hit enter
now open new command prompt go to following directory
"C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.2\bin"
the database server instance will get started 

creating database:
use databasename
now you have created database

lets add a record type the query as below
db.tablename.insert({"username":"manasa1","email":"manasa1@manasa.com})
